Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nMastering Amazon Q Developer with Rules By Aurelien Plancque | August 28, 2025 | in Amazon Q Developer | Permalink\nWhen I first started working with Amazon Q Developer, I was very impressed by its capabilities, but I quickly realized I was falling into a familiar pattern. Development teams that use AI assistants face a common challenge: repeatedly explaining coding standards, workflow options, and established patterns in every conversation. That repeated setup reduces productivity and creates inconsistency in AI guidance across team members. Sound familiar?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I discovered the power of custom rules — and it completely changed how I work with AI assistance.\nWhat are Amazon Q Developer rules? Rules in Amazon Q Developer are a way to build a library of coding standards and best practices that are automatically used as context when interacting with the assistant.\nThese rules are defined in Markdown files stored in your project\u0026rsquo;s .amazonq/rules directory. Once created, they automatically become part of the context for developers interacting with Amazon Q Developer in your project, maintaining consistency among team members regardless of their experience level. Currently, rules are supported in the Amazon Q Developer IDE extensions and in the Amazon Q Developer CLI.\nThe power of rule-based AI assistance What I find most compelling about rule-based AI assistants is how they minimize the repetitive setup that often accompanies AI interactions. Instead of constantly instructing the AI assistant about your preferences and standards for every request, you can define them once as rules. This creates a consistent, predictable AI experience that automatically respects your team\u0026rsquo;s conventions and best practices.\nWhat truly became a game-changer for me is the consistency. Whether I\u0026rsquo;m developing a new feature, debugging, or reviewing code, Amazon Q Developer now understands my context from the start. That means I can focus on solving the real problem instead of repeatedly explaining how I want things done.\nUnderstanding the rule lifecycle\nOne thing that always surprises developers is how seamlessly rules integrate into Amazon Q Developer workflows. Understanding when and how rules are injected into context will help you get the most out of this capability. Here’s how it works:\nRule lifecycle in Amazon Q Developer\nRules are injected at a few important times:\nInitial context load: When you first interact with Amazon Q Developer in a project, it scans the .amazonq/rules directory and loads applicable rules into its context.\nRequest processing: Before generating a response, Amazon Q Developer evaluates your request against the loaded rules to determine which rules apply.\nResponse generation: While generating a response, Amazon Q Developer follows guidance from the active rules, prioritizing them based on assigned priority.\nDynamic updates: If you modify existing rules or add new rules during a session, Amazon Q Developer detects those changes and updates its behavior accordingly. This continuous integration ensures Amazon Q Developer’s responses remain aligned with your standards without requiring you to repeat instructions in every conversation.\nWhy rule-based AI matters What I value most about this approach is how it turns AI from a generic assistant into something that truly understands how your team works. Here are the main benefits I experienced:\nConsistency: Every team member gets the same AI-guided experience, ensuring code and documentation remain consistent regardless of who writes them.\nKnowledge preservation: Rules capture accumulated team knowledge and best practices so everyone can access them.\nCognitive load reduction: You can focus on solving problems instead of remembering and enforcing standards.\nFaster onboarding: New team members automatically receive guidance aligned with your team’s practices.\nAdaptability: Rules can evolve with your project, ensuring AI support stays relevant as your needs change.\nThe difference between a general AI assistant and a rule-guided assistant becomes clear quickly. A general AI may suggest any valid solution, while a rule-guided AI suggests solutions that fit your specific context and standards.\nBuilding effective rules: a practical approach\nNow that you’ve seen the power of rules, let me walk you through creating them. While there is no \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; format for Amazon Q Developer rules (the flexibility is one of the great aspects!), the approach I’m about to share has consistently worked well for me and my team.\nRule file format and location Here’s what I’ve learned about organizing rules for Amazon Q Developer:\nRules should be written in Markdown format (files ending with .md)\nThey should be placed in the .amazonq/rules directory of your project\nYou can use any file names you like, though descriptive names help organization (for example: monitoring-rule.md, frontend-react.rule.md)\nRules can be organized into subfolders for better structure (for example: .amazonq/rules/frontend/react.rule.md) The filename itself is arbitrary — Amazon Q Developer will read the .md files in the directory. However, using meaningful names will make your rule system easier to maintain as it grows.\nEssential rule structure I find it most effective to create a well-designed rule file containing the following primary sections:\nRule Name Purpose A clear, concise statement explaining why this rule exists.\nInstructions Specific directives for Amazon Q Developer to follow Additional instructions with their own identifiers Conditions under which instructions apply Priority [Critical/High/Medium/Low]\nError Handling How Amazon Q Developer should behave when exceptions occur Fallback strategies when primary instructions can\u0026rsquo;t be followed Let me show you how this structure works with a complete example of a monitoring rule that has been particularly effective for my team:\nMonitoring Purpose This rule ensures that monitoring coverage is maintained when major features are added to the project.\nInstructions When implementing a major feature (new service, API endpoint, or core functionality), ALWAYS check if MONITORING_PLAN.md needs updates. Major features include: new microservices, AI integrations, WebSocket endpoints, database operations, external API integrations, or user-facing functionality. ALWAYS update MONITORING_PLAN.md to include relevant metrics, dashboards, and alerts for the new feature. When updating monitoring plan, include: custom metrics, CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and logging requirements specific to the new feature. After updating MONITORING_PLAN.md, ALWAYS output \u0026ldquo;📊 Updated monitoring plan for: [feature description]\u0026rdquo;. Priority High\nError Handling If MONITORING_PLAN.md doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, create it with basic monitoring structure and note the creation If monitoring plan is unreadable, create a backup and start fresh with current feature requirements If unsure whether a feature qualifies as \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo;, err on the side of caution and update monitoring plan I saved this as monitoring.rule.md in my project’s .amazonq/rules directory.\nWhy the rule components work Now I’ll break down each component and show you why this structure is so effective.\nRule name Think of this as the \u0026ldquo;class name\u0026rdquo; for your rule. The class name should be descriptive and domain-specific, such as \u0026ldquo;Frontend – React\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Monitoring\u0026rdquo;. This helps categorize your rules into sensible buckets and makes them easier to maintain as your rule set grows.\nPurpose This section is crucial — it explains the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; behind your rule. What I learned is that a clear purpose helps Amazon Q Developer understand the intent behind your instructions, allowing it to make better decisions in unexpected situations. Example:\nPurpose Ensures consistent monitoring coverage is maintained when adding new features to the project.\nThat simple statement signals Amazon Q Developer to prioritize monitoring considerations even when they aren’t explicitly called out in your request.\nInstructions This is where the magic happens. Instructions are the specific directives that shape Amazon Q Developer’s behavior. I find the most effective instructions are:\nClear and actionable\nFocused on a single aspect of behavior\nFormatted consistently for easy scanning\nExample:\nInstructions When implementing a major feature, ALWAYS check if MONITORING_PLAN.md needs updates. Major features include: new microservices, AI integrations, WebSocket endpoints. After updating MONITORING_PLAN.md, output \u0026ldquo;📊 Updated monitoring plan for: [feature]\u0026rdquo;. These clear, focused instructions give Amazon Q Developer concrete guidance on how to behave in different situations while maintaining consistent responses across your team.\nPriority Not all rules are created equal. What I discovered is that priority levels help Amazon Q Developer resolve conflicts when multiple rules might apply to a situation. I typically use four priority levels:\nCritical: Must be followed with no exceptions\nHigh: Should be followed unless it conflicts with a critical rule\nMedium: Important guidance that shapes behavior\nLow: Optional suggestions that can be overridden when necessary\nError handling This often-overlooked section is what makes rules powerful in real-world situations. Good error-handling instructions tell Amazon Q Developer what to do when things don’t go as planned:\nError Handling If MONITORING_PLAN.md doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, create it with basic monitoring structure If unsure whether a feature qualifies as \u0026ldquo;major,\u0026rdquo; err on the side of caution These fallback strategies ensure Amazon Q Developer remains useful even when it encounters unexpected conditions.\nSee rules in action To illustrate the effectiveness of this structure, here’s a simple example. Without rules, asking Amazon Q Developer to “add a new React component for the user profile” might result in a component that doesn’t match your project’s conventions.\nBut with a well-designed frontend rule, Amazon Q Developer will automatically:\nCheck the existing component structure\nFollow your naming conventions\nCreate appropriate prop interfaces\nAdd the right level of documentation\nPlace the file in your preferred folder structure You don’t need to specify those details every time!\nMaking rules transparent: a game-changing technique One especially effective technique I discovered is teaching Amazon Q Developer to explicitly acknowledge which rules it’s following. This is not default behavior for Amazon Q Developer, but it’s a custom enhancement you can implement via a specific conversation rule.\nAdd unique traceable identifiers The core of this system is adding unique identifiers (IDs) to each instruction in your rule. For example:\nInstructions When implementing a major feature, ALWAYS check if MONITORING_PLAN.md needs updates. (ID: CHECK_MONITORING_PLAN) Major features include: new microservices, AI integrations, WebSocket endpoints. (ID: MAJOR_FEATURE_CRITERIA) After updating MONITORING_PLAN.md, output \u0026ldquo;📊 Updated monitoring plan for: [feature]\u0026rdquo;. (ID: ANNOUNCE_MONITORING_UPDATE) These IDs act as \u0026ldquo;trackable signals\u0026rdquo; that Amazon Q Developer can reference when following a rule.\nCreate acknowledgment behavior Next, you can create a conversation rule that instructs Amazon Q Developer to acknowledge which rules it is applying. Here is a complete example of that rule:\nConversation Purpose This rule defines how Amazon Q Developer should behave in conversations, including how it should acknowledge other rules it\u0026rsquo;s following.\nInstructions ALWAYS consider your rules before using a tool or responding. (ID: CHECK_RULES) When acting based on a rule, ALWAYS print \u0026ldquo;Rule used: filename (ID)\u0026rdquo; at the very beginning of your response. (ID: PRINT_RULES) If multiple rules are matched, list all: \u0026ldquo;Rule used: file1.rule.md (ID1), file2.rule.md (ID2)\u0026rdquo;. (ID: PRINT_MULTIPLE) DO NOT start responses with general mentions about using rules or context, but DO print specific rule usage as specified above. (ID: NO_GENERIC_MENTIONS) Priority Critical\nError Handling If rule files are unreadable, continue but note the issue If multiple conflicting rules apply, follow the highest priority rule and note the conflict Save this as conversation.rule.md in your .amazonq/rules directory.\nWhen Amazon Q Developer follows a rule, it will state which rule and identifier guided its action:\nYou can ask Amazon Q Developer to state the instructions it is following.\nWhat I find most valuable about this simple addition are the noticeable benefits it brings:\nTransparency: Team members can immediately see which instructions influenced the Amazon Q Developer’s response\nDebugging: When Amazon Q Developer behaves unexpectedly, you can identify which rule caused the behavior\nLearning: New team members discover relevant rules by seeing which ones are applied\nValidation: You can confirm your rules are working as intended\nContinuous improvement: Identify which rules are used most often and which may need refinement\nBy exposing rules, you turn Amazon Q Developer into a collaborative partner that not only follows your guidelines but helps team members discover and interact with your established processes. IDs are not just an organizational tool — they form the foundation of a self-documenting AI support process that becomes more valuable as your rule system grows.\nStart with your own rules\nWhat I like about this approach is you can start small. Begin with one or two rules that address your most common pain points, and expand as you see benefits. Good starting points include:\nCode style and organization rules\nDocumentation standards\nTesting requirements\nGit commit message format\nRemember, the goal is not to create a comprehensive rulebook but to capture the aspects of your development process that most affect your team’s productivity and code quality.\nReal examples: rules in action To show the practical impact of rules, let me walk you through some specific situations that illustrate how rules transform the AI-assisted experience. These examples highlight the difference between generic AI assistance and rule-guided assistance.\nScenario 1: Time-based data analysis This scenario demonstrates how rules help Amazon Q Developer understand your environment’s context for time-related operations and analyses. Below are examples of how I apply this rule in VS Code.\nHere is the rule I use to tell Amazon Q Developer how to behave when it needs to understand the current time:\nTime Purpose This rule defines how Amazon Q Developer (the agent) handles time-related operations and queries\nInstructions When determining the current time, ALWAYS use bash commands with AEST timezone: date (ID: GET_AEST_TIME) When timestamps are needed for logging or documentation, use ISO format with AEST timezone (ID: ISO_TIMESTAMP) When comparing times or calculating durations, ensure all times are in AEST for consistency (ID: CONSISTENT_TIMEZONE) For time-sensitive operations, always verify the current AEST time before proceeding (ID: VERIFY_TIME) Priority Medium\nError Handling If date command fails, note the system time issue and continue with available information If timezone conversion is needed, use appropriate date formatting commands No rule: When Amazon Q Developer has no time rule, it lacks the necessary context for time-based queries:\nAmazon Q Developer interaction without a time rule\nAs you can see, without the rule, Amazon Q Developer needs clarification about timezone context and does not know how to determine the current time in your environment.\nWith the Time Rule: Here is a similar query with the time rule applied:\nAmazon Q Developer follows the rule guidance\nNotice how Amazon Q Developer immediately uses the date command to get the current AEST time, exactly as specified in the rule, without further clarification.\nImpact:\nAutomatic context: Amazon Q Developer immediately knows to use the date command to fetch AEST time\nNo need for explicit clarification: It understands \u0026ldquo;yesterday\u0026rdquo; relative to the current AEST time without asking\nConsistent behavior: The same approach applies to other time-based queries among team members\nEnvironment awareness: It knows exactly how to determine time in your specific system environment\nTransparent process: You can see it following the rule by using the bash date command as specified This example shows how a time rule turns a potentially confusing interaction into a smooth, context-aware analysis with consistent behavior.\nScenario 2: UI component development This scenario demonstrates how rules can help prevent technical debt accumulation and maintain consistent component architecture across your team.\nNo rule: When Amazon Q Developer has no frontend guidance, different developers might receive inconsistent suggestions for building components. Some might get immediately reusable components, others copy-paste solutions, and component organization can vary based on personal preference.\nWith Frontend rules: Here is a practical React rule from my development process that addresses this consistency problem:\nFrontend - React Purpose Defines how to act when writing React\nInstructions ALWAYS evaluate reusability potential for new visual elements using these criteria: used in 2+ places, has configurable props, or represents a common UI pattern. (ID: EVALUATE_REUSABILITY) If reusability potential is high (meets 2+ criteria above), create a dedicated component in appropriate folder (components/, shared/, or ui/) with clear prop interfaces and JSDoc comments. (ID: CREATE_REUSABLE_COMPONENT) When creating reusable components, include explicit comments explaining: purpose, key props, usage examples, and any important behavior. (ID: DOCUMENT_COMPONENTS) Follow existing component structure and naming conventions found in the project\u0026rsquo;s components folder. (ID: FOLLOW_CONVENTIONS) Prefer composition over inheritance - create small, focused components that can be combined. (ID: PREFER_COMPOSITION) Priority Medium\nError Handling If component folder structure is unclear, place new components in src/components/ and ask user for preferred organization If existing conventions are inconsistent, follow the most recent or most common pattern and note the inconsistency Impact:\nConsistent architecture: Team members receive the same guidance for creating components regardless of experience level\nReduced technical debt: Automatic reusability evaluation helps prevent duplicated UI components\nBetter documentation: Components automatically include appropriate JSDoc comments and usage examples\nMaintainable structure: Consistent naming conventions and folder organization across the project\nScalable patterns: The component-focused approach produces more flexible, reusable components\nThis ensures that whether a junior developer or a senior architect works with Amazon Q Developer, the components produced conform to the same quality standards and architectural patterns.\nScenario 3: Version control workflow This scenario demonstrates how rules can act as safety mechanisms and workflow gatekeepers, enabling version-control activities to be performed consistently.\nNo rule: Amazon Q Developer might suggest git operations without considering your team’s workflow preferences or safety requirements. It might propose immediate pushes, generic commit messages, or skip confirmation steps that help prevent mistakes.\nWith a Git Rule: Here is a real git rule that changes how Amazon Q Developer handles version-control operations:\nGit Purpose This rule dictates Amazon Q Developer (the agent) behavior related to git.\nInstructions ALWAYS ask confirmation from the user before pushing to git (ID: GIT_PUSH) ALWAYS ensure commit messages are meaningful and detailed, including what was changed and why (ID: GIT_COMMIT) Commit message should be accurate but playful and not too formal, with comprehensive details about the changes (ID: GIT_COMMIT_STYLE) Include specific files/components modified and the impact of changes in commit messages (ID: GIT_COMMIT_DETAILS) Priority Medium\nError Handling N/A\nHere is the rule applied when I asked Amazon Q Developer to commit our changes:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s commit our latest changes to git. Rule used: git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT), git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT_STYLE), git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT_DETAILS) I\u0026rsquo;ll commit all the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made to remove messaging functionality and focus the platform on location-based discovery. Let me create a comprehensive commit with all the modifications. 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ● I will run the following shell command: cd /path/to/your/project/rules-blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git status ↳ Purpose: Check git status to see all changed files On branch main Changes not staged for commit: [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;] Untracked files: [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;] ● Completed in 0.54s 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ● I will run the following shell command: cd /path/to/your/project/rules-blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add . ↳ Purpose: Add all changes to git staging ● Completed in 0.101s 🛠️ Using tool: execute_bash (trusted) ● I will run the following shell command: cd /path/to/your/project/rules-blog \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \u0026ldquo;🎯 Refocus platform on location-based discovery: Remove messaging, complete React app Major platform refocus to pure location-based discovery: MESSAGING FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED: [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;] DOCUMENTATION UPDATES: [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;] INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS: [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;] PLATFORM FOCUS NOW: ✅ Location-based discovery ✅ Browsing and following ✅ Information and contact details ✅ Notifications by location ❌ No messaging/booking - pure discovery platform Files modified: 13 core files, 1 new frontend package Infrastructure: 7 Lambda functions, tagged resources, clean API Tests: 12/12 passing, production build successful\u0026rdquo; [\u0026hellip; output truncated for brevity \u0026hellip;]\nNote: Notice how Amazon Q Developer automatically displays Rule used: git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT), git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT_STYLE), git.rule.md (GIT_COMMIT_DETAILS) at the start of the response — this is the rule transparency system we discussed earlier in action, showing exactly which rule instructions guided the creation of the commit message.\nImpact:\nPrevents accidents: Requiring confirmation prevents accidental pushes that could disrupt team workflows\nConsistent commit quality: Commit messages follow the same detailed, informative style regardless of who does the work\nTeam personality: The \u0026ldquo;playful but not overly formal\u0026rdquo; style preserves team culture while remaining professional\nBetter git history: Detailed commit messages make code archaeology far easier for future debugging\nWorkflow safety: Acts as a safety gate that preserves human oversight in critical operations\nThis rule demonstrates that Amazon Q Developer can be more than a code assistant — it becomes a workflow partner that understands and enforces your team\u0026rsquo;s operational choices and safety requirements.\nNext steps for rule-driven development Through exploring Amazon Q Developer’s rules, we discovered how a simple concept — define your preferences once instead of repeating them — can transform your development workflow. The main lessons are clear: rules reduce repetitive setup, support team consistency, preserve organizational knowledge, and create transparent AI interactions that become more valuable over time.\nReduced cognitive load, faster onboarding, consistent code quality, and AI that truly understands your team\u0026rsquo;s context — the initial solution to repetitive explanations has evolved into a comprehensive system to scale development processes across my team.\nMy Amazon Q Developer rule system continues to evolve, and I’m excited about the possibilities ahead. As more teams adopt this approach, I hope we’ll see community-shared rule libraries and even more sophisticated customization options.\nWhat I find most promising is how rules lay the groundwork for more advanced AI assistance. When your AI assistant deeply understands your context, it can offer more nuanced suggestions and detect potential issues before they become problems.\nI encourage you to start experimenting with rules — pick an area where you frequently repeat instructions to the AI assistant and create your first rule. You’ll be surprised how quickly this approach transforms your development workflow.\nImportantly, remember that rules are not intended to stifle creativity — they free you to focus on the interesting problems by automating routine decisions. When Amazon Q Developer understands how you want things done, you can spend more time on what you’re building and less time on how you build it.\nAre you ready to get started with Amazon Q Developer rules for developers?

	"content": " ⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only. Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nResolve customer issues via two-way SMS (text messaging) in Amazon Connect by Abhishek Pandey and Amit Gupta | August 27, 2025 | in Advanced (300), Technical How-to | Permalink |\nIntroduction\nAs of 2023, Short Message Service (SMS) has achieved global reach with approximately 5 billion unique users. With 80% of adults using text messages to communicate, it is an essential tool for reaching a broad audience. Amazon Connect’s two-way Short Message Service (SMS) capability enables you to address customer issues via text messaging. This service provides customers with a convenient channel while allowing you to deliver a personalized experience at a lower cost.\nMost consumers are familiar with SMS text messages for personal communication purposes. Customers can easily initiate conversations or respond to SMS notifications or appointment reminders to receive assistance from an agent.\nIn this blog post, we will demonstrate how to use SMS with your Amazon Connect contact center. This solution allows customers to respond to your SMS campaigns. Your agents can receive and reply to customer SMS messages from the same workspace that they use for other channels such as voice, chat, and tasks.\nSolution Overview and Architecture\nFigure 1: Solution Architecture\nThe customer sends an SMS message from their mobile device to the SMS-enabled phone number on Amazon Connect.\nAWS End User Messaging sends the SMS message as a chat contact to Amazon Connect.\nThe customer interacts with an Amazon Lex bot over SMS, which collects information through a series of questions. When the customer requests agent assistance, the conversation moves to the next step.\nAmazon Connect routes the contact to an agent along with all the information the Amazon Lex bot previously collected. The agent can then begin responding to customer SMS messages.\nAmazon Connect routes the agent’s response to the customer through AWS End User Messaging.\nAWS End User Messaging sends the response to the customer’s mobile device as an SMS message.\nPrerequisites\nFor this tutorial, you will need the following prerequisites:\nAn AWS account with administrator access to the following services – Amazon Connect, AWS End User Messaging, Amazon Lex\nAn Amazon Connect Instance\nAmazon Connect two-way SMS\nAn agent created and associated with the Basic Routing Profile and Basic Queue. Ensure that the Routing Profile has Chat enabled under Channel Availability.\nDeploying the Solution\nThis post walks through a patient contacting the Wellness Clinic to schedule an appointment. The patient sends an SMS message to the clinic’s phone number. Initially, the patient interacts with a bot, then is transferred to a live agent for further assistance.\nStep 1: Create an Amazon Lex Bot\nSign in to AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon Lex console.\nIf this is your first bot, select Get Started; otherwise, on the Bots page, under Action, choose Import from the drop-down menu. For more details, refer to Importing and Exporting bots in Amazon Lex V2.\nAdd the bot name: AppointmentScheduler\nDownload the bot from this link\nSelect Browse file, then select the bot you downloaded in step 4\nPassword is optional\nFigure 2: Importing Amazon Lex V2 bot\nFor IAM permissions, select Create a role with basic Amazon Lex permissions\nFor COPPA, select No\nLeave the idle session timeout as the default value\nFigure 3: Amazon Lex V2 Import – IAM and COPPA\nAdvanced settings are optional and do not require changes. Leave the default value for Warn before overwriting existing bots with the same name.\nFigure 4: Amazon Lex V2 Import – Advanced settings\nSelect Import. You will receive the confirmation: “File successfully imported and created bot AppointmentScheduler”\nStep 2: Build the Amazon Lex Bot\nNavigate to the Amazon Lex dashboard and select Bots. Click the bot AppointmentScheduler. Under All languages, select English (US). Choose Build.\nFigure 5: Build Amazon Lex V2 bot\nStep 3: Add the Amazon Lex Bot to your Connect Instance\nTo open Amazon Connect console, search for Amazon Connect in the search bar and select it.\nFigure 6: Search and select Amazon Connect\nSelect the Amazon Connect instance you want to integrate with your Amazon Lex bot. In the navigation menu, choose Flows.\nFigure 7: Configure flows for Amazon Connect\nIn Amazon Lex, use the dropdown to select the Region of your Amazon Lex bot, then select your bot AppointmentScheduler. Select the bot alias TestBotAlias from the drop-down, then choose + Add Amazon Lex bot.\nNote: Create a new alias for production and do not use TestBotAlias.\nFigure 8: Add Amazon Lex bot to Amazon Connect Instance\nStep 4: Create Amazon Connect Flow\nSign in to your Amazon Connect instance with an account that has permissions for Amazon Connect Flows and Amazon Lex bots. Download the file from the link. From the navigation menu, select Routing and Flows. Click Create Flow. Click the drop-down next to Save, select Import (beta).\nFigure 9: Create Connect Flow\nClick Choose File, browse to the file you downloaded in step 2, select Import.\nFigure 10: Import Connect Flow\nAfter the flow is successfully imported:\nClick the Get Customer Input block and select AppointmentScheduler for Lex bot and TestBotAlias for Alias\nSelect Save\nFigure 11: Modify Get Customer Input block\nSelect the Set Working Queue block and select Basic Queue as shown\nFigure 12: Modify working queue block\nSelect Save, then Publish the flow\nStep 5: Associate Amazon Connect Flow to a SMS Phone Number\nOn the left menu, navigate to Channels → Phone numbers Click the SMS-enabled phone number In Contact Flow/IVR, select SMSBlogFlow from the dropdown and click Save\nFigure 13: Associate Connect Flow to SMS phone number\nCongratulations! You have successfully added SMS functionality to your Amazon Connect Contact Center.\nBelow is a screenshot of a patient interacting from their mobile phone via SMS message.\nPatient contacting the Wellness Clinic phone number and conversing with the bot.\nFigure 14: Patient interaction with Amazon Lex bot over SMS\nThe patient is then transferred to a live agent to continue receiving help.\nFigure 15: Interaction of patient with Amazon Lex bot and live agent via SMS\nThe agent uses the Amazon Connect CCP (Contact Control Panel) to respond to the patient’s SMS messages.\nFigure 16: CCP view showing patient interaction with live agent over SMS\nClean Up\nIf desired, export the latest version of your Lex bot and save it\nIf desired, export the SMSBlogFlow Connect flow from Amazon Connect\nDisconnect the SMS-enabled phone number from the SMSBlogFlow contact flow\nIn the left menu, navigate to Channels → Phone numbers\nClick the phone number you used to test SMS flow\nIn Contact Flow/IVR, click X on the far right and Save\nDelete the Amazon Lex bot you imported\nArchive and delete the Amazon Connect flow you imported\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we demonstrated how to enhance SMS messaging capabilities for your Amazon Connect contact center. This solution simplifies customer interaction by enabling direct SMS responses, providing a more efficient and convenient experience for your customers.\nAs businesses continue to prioritize customer experience, adding SMS support can drive customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs.

They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nAWS First Cloud AI Journey – Project Plan Online Shopping Website: Furious Five Fashion (FFF) AWS \u0026amp; AI-Powered E-commerce Website Solution 1. Background and Motivation 1.1 Executive Summary The client is a small-sized business specializing in fashion products for young customers. They aim to build an online clothing e-commerce website using AWS and AI, with the ability to scale flexibly, support long-term growth, and optimize operational costs.\nThe goal of this project is to shift from traditional manual management on physical servers to a flexible, intelligent, and cost-efficient cloud-based model. AWS enables the system to scale at any time, maintain fast access speed, and allow the business to focus on product development instead of infrastructure.\nThe system is designed to support end-to-end e-commerce operations: hosting and distributing web content, managing product and order databases, supporting payments, and monitoring system performance. Everything aims toward stability, security, and long-term scalability.\nThe Furious Five implementation team will accompany the client throughout the process—advising, designing the architecture, and configuring key AWS services such as Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, and Route 53. Beyond building the system, they also help optimize costs, ensure security, and train the internal team to manage the infrastructure effectively.\nThis project is not just a technical plan—it marks an important step in the company’s digital transformation journey.\n1.2 Project Success Criteria To ensure the success of the Furious Five Fashion project, the following clear and measurable criteria must be met, representing both business goals and technical effectiveness:\nSystem Performance The website must maintain response times under 2 seconds for all user actions, even during peak hours.\nAvailability The system must achieve 99.9% uptime, monitored and automatically reported through services like CloudWatch.\nScalability AWS infrastructure must scale automatically when traffic increases by at least 2× without causing service disruption.\nCost Optimization Monthly operating costs must remain under 30% of the projected budget, supported by AWS cost-monitoring tools such as Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor.\nSecurity No data leaks or unauthorized access. All customer data must be protected by AWS security standards (IAM policies, encryption, HTTPS, etc.).\nDeployment \u0026amp; Operations Infrastructure must be fully deployed within 4 weeks, with complete documentation so the internal team can manage the environment effectively.\nTraining \u0026amp; Knowledge Transfer The internal technical team must be trained to confidently maintain, monitor, and secure the system without depending entirely on external support.\n1.3 Assumptions To ensure alignment and smooth execution of the FFF project, the following assumptions have been made:\nThe team already has access to AWS accounts with required permissions and has basic knowledge of essential AWS services such as Lambda, S3, IAM, and Route 53. Stable Internet connectivity is assumed since all infrastructure runs in the cloud. The team is also aware of basic security and compliance requirements before deployment.\nThe project depends on multiple external factors: stable service availability in the selected AWS region, smooth domain routing via Route 53, and effective collaboration between development teams to ensure the web application operates properly in the cloud environment.\nThe project is part of an internship, so the budget is limited—favoring free-tier usage and low-cost service configurations. Due to limited experience and tight timelines, the chosen architecture remains simple and practical.\nPotential risks include IAM misconfigurations, accidental overspending due to unused resources, AWS regional outages, service incompatibilities, or limited expertise in troubleshooting cloud systems.\nDespite these risks, the project is built on clear expectations: this is a pilot environment, with layered monitoring, backup, and cost-management strategies in place. Every challenge is considered an opportunity to learn and grow in cloud engineering.\n2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE 2.1 Technical Architecture Diagram The following architecture is designed for FFF, deployed in AWS Region Singapore (ap-southeast-1). It emphasizes flexibility, security, automation, scalability, and simplicity—appropriate for an internship-level project while following AWS best practices.\nThe system follows a multi-layer design consisting of six key components:\nFrontend \u0026amp; Security Layer Users access the website through Route 53. Incoming traffic is protected with AWS WAF and optimized via CloudFront. Source code is managed and deployed through GitLab CI/CD using CloudFormation templates.\nAPI \u0026amp; Compute Layer API Gateway routes all requests to AWS Lambda, which handles application logic. Cognito manages authentication and access control.\nStorage Layer Two S3 buckets store static content (StaticData) and user uploads.\nData Layer DynamoDB stores product metadata and unstructured data. IAM ensures secure interactions between components.\nAI Layer Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Bedrock power image processing and generative AI features.\nObservability \u0026amp; Security Layer CloudWatch, SNS, and SES provide monitoring, alerting, and system notifications.\n2.2 Technical Implementation Plan Infrastructure will be managed and deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation to ensure repeatability, stability, and ease of maintenance.\nKey AWS components—S3, Lambda, API Gateway, VPC, RDS , Cognito, and CloudWatch—will be defined entirely through CloudFormation templates stored in GitLab for version control and rollback capability.\nSensitive configurations such as IAM permissions or WAF rules require approval before deployment and follow the internal governance process with review and validation.\nAll critical system paths—from authentication to data processing—are covered by automated and manual test cases to ensure stability, security, and scalability.\nThis technical plan enables the FFF team to deploy and manage a professional cloud environment, learning real DevOps and AWS best practices.\n2.3 Project Plan The project follows Agile Scrum over 3 months, divided into 4 sprints.\nSprint Structure\nSprint Planning\nSetup AWS foundational services (S3, Route 53, IAM)\nConfigure security (WAF, CloudFront)\nIntegrate backend (Lambda, API Gateway, RDS)\nTesting, optimization, and demo preparation\nDaily Stand-up 30-minute updates to address blockers and track status.\nSprint Review Review deliverables, demo on real AWS environment, fix issues.\nRetrospective Improve DevOps workflows and automation pipeline.\nTeam Roles\nProduct Owner: Business alignment, backlog prioritization\nScrum Master: Coordination, Agile process enforcement\nDevOps/Technical Team: Backend, infrastructure, CI/CD\nMentor / AWS Partner: Architecture validation, AI testing, cost \u0026amp; security review\nCommunication Rhythm\nDaily Stand-ups (23:00)\nWeekly Sync\nEnd-of-Sprint Demo\nKnowledge Transfer After the final sprint, the technical team will deliver hands-on training on operations, monitoring (Budgets, CloudWatch), scaling, and recovery procedures.\n2.4 Security Considerations Access Management MFA for admin users; IAM roles with least privilege; auditing through CloudTrail.\nInfrastructure Security\ndedicated VPC, services are restricted using resource policies; all public endpoints use HTTPS.\nData Protection\nS3 and RDS encryption; TLS data transfer; manual periodic backups.\nDetection \u0026amp; Monitoring\nCloudTrail, Config, and CloudWatch for visibility; GuardDuty for threat detection.\nIncident Response\nClear incident workflows with log collection, analysis, and periodic simulations.\n3.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

	"content": "Overview In this section, you will create an Interface endpoint to access Amazon S3 from a simulated on-premises environment. The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"
